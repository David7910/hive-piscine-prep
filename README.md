# Hive Helsinki - Piscine Prep

This repository documents my daily warm-up before the 3-week Sprint & later Piscine at Hive Helsinki.

## Why this repo?

I have 15+ years background in IT (Dev + Infra + Data).  
However I have been away from coding for the last ~1-2 years.  
This prep is to re-activate my C, Linux and Git muscle memory.

## Daily structure

- 60 minutes / day hands-on
- C fundamentals (pointers, memory, string, struct)
- Linux + Shell scripting
- clean commits + incremental builds

## Goal

Be in fluent “production mode” in C inside a Unix environment.

## System

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (English UI)
- gcc (build-essential)
- git

## Notes

English: reading & writing fluent, spoken: comfortable daily conversation (CET-6 China).  
Learning Finnish (A1 level) in parallel.
